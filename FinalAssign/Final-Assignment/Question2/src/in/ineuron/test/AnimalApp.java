	 * A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. A
	 * constructor has the same name as the class it is defined in. A constructor
	 * does not have a return type. A constructor can be used to initialize the
	 * object's fields. A constructor can be overloaded, which means that there can
	 * be more than one constructor with the same name, but with different parameter
	 * lists. If a class does not define any constructors, the Java compiler will
	 * automatically create a default constructor for you.
